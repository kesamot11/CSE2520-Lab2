# This program should take an fileIn as first parameter
# It takes the input text file and outputs the 5 most common word bigrams (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram) in the file.
# Your solution should be case insensitive.
#
# example: when `./bigrams.sh ../data/myBook/01-chapter1.txt' is ran the output should look like this:
#   3 the     little
#   3 little  blind
#   3 blind   text
#   2 the     word
#   2 the     copy
